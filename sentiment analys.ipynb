And the screen is not solid black, test a gray screen to test!! If you encounter something like this, you should contact the warranty!! I will send some pictures to understand the situation! The dark theme must be dark and the brightness must be at 10% for the test!!\n","Tokens Used: 4259\n","\tPrompt Tokens: 4183\n","\t\tPrompt Tokens Cached: 0\n","\tCompletion Tokens: 76\n","\t\tReasoning Tokens: 0\n","Successful Requests: 1\n","Total Cost (USD): $0.0006730499999999999\n","{'Overall sentiment': 'Neutral', 'Inner emotion': ['Surprise', 'Fear'], 'Recommend': 'false', 'Mentioned Aspects': ['screen', 'dark theme', 'brightness', 'warranty'], 'Aspect Opinions': {'screen': 'poor', 'dark theme': 'poor', 'brightness': 'average', 'warranty': 'good'}}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"LsYGFzxWXEO3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
